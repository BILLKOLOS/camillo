# Three Major Transaction Types Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the three major transaction types in the Camillo Investments admin dashboard as requested.

## Overview

The admin dashboard now includes three distinct transaction management sections:

1. **User Deposits** - Manual deposit requests from users
2. **Total Investments** - Active investments with expected profits
3. **Pending Withdrawals** - Completed investments ready for withdrawal approval

## 1. User Deposits

### Description
Users who have made deposit requests but have not yet made any investments. The admin can see all pending deposit requests and manually approve them to update the user's balance.

### Flow
1. User creates a manual deposit request
2. Admin sees the request in "User Deposits" section
3. Admin confirms payment and approves the deposit
4. User's balance is updated in their dashboard

### Backend Changes
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/investments/admin/user-deposits`
- **Controller**: `getUserDeposits()` in `investmentController.ts`
- **Model**: Uses existing `ManualDepositRequest` model

### Frontend Changes
- **New View**: `user-deposits` in admin dashboard
- **New State**: `userDeposits`, `loadingUserDeposits`
- **New Handler**: Fetches and displays pending deposit requests

## 2. Total Investments

### Description
Active investments that users have made using their updated balance. Shows the investment amount, expected profit (60%), and current status.

### Flow
1. User makes an investment using their balance
2. Investment appears in "Total Investments" section
3. Shows status as "active" before expiry, "completed" after expiry
4. Displays amount, expected profit, and payment status

### Backend Changes
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/investments/admin/total-investments`
- **Controller**: `getTotalInvestments()` in `investmentController.ts`
- **Model**: Enhanced `Investment` model with user tracking fields

### Frontend Changes
- **New View**: `total-investments` in admin dashboard
- **New State**: `totalInvestments`, `loadingTotalInvestments`
- **Display**: Shows user, amount, expected profit, status, and payment status

## 3. Pending Withdrawals

### Description
Completed investments that are automatically marked for withdrawal approval. When an investment reaches its expiry time, it's automatically marked as "completed" and appears in this section.

### Flow
1. Investment expires and status changes to "completed"
2. Automatically marked as "pending withdrawal"
3. Admin can approve the withdrawal
4. Investment is marked as "paid"

### Backend Changes
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/investments/admin/pending-withdrawals`
- **New Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/investments/admin/:investmentId/approve-withdrawal`
- **Controller**: `getPendingWithdrawals()` and `approveWithdrawal()` in `investmentController.ts`
- **Model**: Enhanced `Investment` model with `withdrawalStatus` field
- **Auto-completion**: Updated `completeExpiredInvestments()` to automatically mark as pending withdrawal

### Frontend Changes
- **Updated View**: `pending-withdrawals` now shows investment-based withdrawals
- **New State**: `pendingWithdrawalsInvestments`, `loadingPendingWithdrawals`
- **New Handler**: `handleApproveInvestmentWithdrawal()` for approving withdrawals

## Database Schema Changes

### Investment Model Updates
```typescript
// New fields added to Investment model
userName?: string;           // User's name for direct access
userPhone?: string;          // User's phone for direct access
withdrawalStatus?: 'pending' | 'paid';  // Withdrawal approval status
withdrawalApprovedAt?: Date; // When withdrawal was approved
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
1. `GET /api/investments/admin/user-deposits` - Get pending user deposits
2. `GET /api/investments/admin/total-investments` - Get active investments
3. `GET /api/investments/admin/pending-withdrawals` - Get pending withdrawals
4. `PATCH /api/investments/admin/:investmentId/approve-withdrawal` - Approve withdrawal

### Updated Endpoints
- `POST /api/investments/complete-expired` - Now automatically marks as pending withdrawal

## Frontend Components

### New Dashboard Cards
- **User Deposits**: Shows count of pending deposit requests
- **Total Investments**: Shows count of active investments
- **Pending Withdrawals**: Shows count of pending withdrawal approvals

### New Views
- **User Deposits View**: Table with pending deposit requests and approve/reject actions
- **Total Investments View**: Table with active investments showing amounts and expected profits
- **Updated Pending Withdrawals View**: Table with completed investments ready for withdrawal approval

## Key Features

### Automatic Status Updates
- Investments automatically change from "active" to "completed" when they expire
- Completed investments are automatically marked as "pending withdrawal"
- No manual intervention required for status transitions

### User Tracking
- Investment records now include user name and phone for direct access
- No need to join with User table for basic information

### Admin Actions
- **Approve/Reject Deposits**: Admin can approve or reject user deposit requests
- **Approve Withdrawals**: Admin can mark completed investments as paid
- **View Investment Details**: See amounts, expected profits, and status

## Testing

A test script `test-new-endpoints.js` is provided to verify the new endpoints work correctly.

### Running Tests
```bash
node test-new-endpoints.js
```

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- Existing investments will work with the new system
- New fields will be undefined for existing records but won't break functionality
- The system gracefully handles missing user information

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing endpoints continue to work
- Frontend maintains compatibility with existing data structures
- New fields are optional and don't break existing functionality

## Usage Examples

### User Deposit Flow
1. John creates a deposit request for KSH 4000
2. Admin sees John's request in "User Deposits"
3. Admin confirms payment and clicks "Approve"
4. John's balance is updated to KSH 4000

### Investment Flow
1. John makes an investment of KSH 3000
2. Investment appears in "Total Investments" with status "active"
3. Shows expected profit of KSH 1800 (60%)
4. After expiry, status changes to "completed" and appears in "Pending Withdrawals"

### Withdrawal Flow
1. Completed investment appears in "Pending Withdrawals"
2. Admin clicks "Mark as Paid"
3. Investment withdrawal status changes to "paid"
4. User can now withdraw their funds

## Security

- User data is properly sanitized and validated
- No sensitive information is exposed in responses
- Proper error handling for all operations

## Future Enhancements

- Add email notifications for status changes
- Implement bulk approval actions
- Add detailed transaction history
- Create audit logs for admin actions

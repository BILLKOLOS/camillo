# Completed Investments Notification System

## Overview

The red badge notification system for the "Total Investments" StatCard has been implemented to notify administrators when new investments are completed since their last view of the section.

## Features

### ðŸ”´ Red Badge Notification
- **Location**: "Total Investments" StatCard in the Admin Dashboard
- **Trigger**: New completed investments since last view
- **Display**: Red badge with count of new completed investments
- **Clear**: Automatically clears when clicking on "Total Investments" section

### ðŸ“Š Real-time Monitoring
- **Check Frequency**: Every 30 seconds
- **Smart Tracking**: Only tracks from the first time the admin views the section
- **Notification**: Shows toast notification when new investments are completed

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### New Endpoint
- **Route**: `GET /api/investments/admin/completed-investments`
- **Query Parameters**: 
  - `since` (optional): ISO date string to filter investments completed after this date
- **Response**: Array of completed investments with user details

#### Controller Function
```typescript
export const getCompletedInvestments = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Returns completed investments, optionally filtered by date
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### New Service Method
```typescript
async getCompletedInvestments(since?: string): Promise<Investment[]>
```

#### State Management
- `lastTotalInvestmentsView`: Tracks when admin last viewed the section
- `newCompletedInvestmentsCount`: Count of new completed investments
- `selectedView`: Current active view in admin dashboard

#### Periodic Checking
- Checks for new completed investments every 30 seconds
- Only shows notifications when not currently viewing the section
- Updates badge count in real-time

## User Experience

### For Administrators
1. **Initial Load**: No badge shown until first view of "Total Investments"
2. **New Completions**: Red badge appears with count when investments complete
3. **Toast Notification**: Informational message about new completions
4. **View Section**: Click "Total Investments" to view details and clear badge
5. **Real-time Updates**: Badge updates automatically as new investments complete

### Badge Behavior
- **Shows**: When `newCompletedInvestmentsCount > 0`
- **Hides**: When admin clicks "Total Investments" section
- **Updates**: Every 30 seconds automatically
- **Color**: Red (`theme.colors.error`)

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Lightweight API calls every 30 seconds
- Only checks when admin has viewed the section at least once
- Efficient date-based filtering on backend

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if API calls fail
- Console logging for debugging
- No impact on main dashboard functionality

### Security

- JWT token authentication required
- Proper authorization middleware

## Testing

```bash
node test-completed-investments-endpoint.js
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Configurable check frequency
